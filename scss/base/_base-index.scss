// All Base Styles In Here

/* A Base rule is applied to an element 
using an element selector, a descendent 
selector, or a child selector, along 
with any pseudo-classes. It doesnâ€™t 
include any class or ID selectors. It 
is defining the default styling for how 
that element should look in all 
occurrences on the page. */
